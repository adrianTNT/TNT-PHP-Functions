# TNT-PHP-Functions

While working on different personal websites I noticed that I always need same kind of PHP functions (truncate text, resize images, etc) so I decided to keep a centralised location for them.

Many of them might need work, so feel free to improve/comment/etc.

Thanks. 

Make an array of values and post them to given URL, get reply like with <code>get_url();</code>

<code>tnt_post_url('script.php', $post_data_array);</code>
